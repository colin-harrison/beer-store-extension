# Beer Store Analytics

## What is it?

A chrome extension to be used with thebeerstore.ca

## What does it do?

This extension will make a simple modification to The Beer Store's website that will evaluate and show the price per fl. oz of alcohol for each option shown on the website. Beer Store Analytics should allow users to identify the most cost effective option for their desired beer. For example, 24 tallboys of Waterloo Dark will run you about $1.81 per 1.5 oz of alcohol, but 24 bottles will cost you just $1.69 per 1.5 oz of alcohol despite the bottles actually being a smaller quantity of beer. Small savings like this will be more apparent to consumers using Beer Store Analytics.
